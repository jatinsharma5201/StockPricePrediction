# Stock Price Prediction

This project demonstrates stock price prediction using machine learning models to forecast future prices based on historical data. Leveraging models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and ARIMA, this repository provides a framework for stock analysis and prediction.

## Project Overview

This repository focuses on predicting stock prices by utilizing various machine learning and deep learning models. With historical data and a combination of technical indicators, it attempts to provide a robust prediction system.

## Features

- Stock data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Training and testing with models including LSTM, ARIMA, and more
- Visualization of predictions alongside actual stock prices

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/StockPricePrediction.git
   cd StockPricePrediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset in CSV format. Ensure it includes columns such as `Date`, `Open`, `Close`, `High`, `Low`, and `Volume`.

2. Run the Jupyter notebook to process data, train models, and generate predictions:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook StockPredict.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the notebook to load data, select models, and visualize predictions.



## Models Used

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: A recurrent neural network effective for time-series forecasting.
- **ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)**: A statistical model for time-series analysis.
- **Other Models**: Additional machine learning models for experimentation and comparative analysis.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding time-series forecasting techniques
- Applying deep learning to predict financial data
- Gaining insights into stock trends through data visualization
